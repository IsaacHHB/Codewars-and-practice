//Price of Mangoes
//There's a "3 for 2" (or "2+1" if you like) offer on mangoes. For a given quantity and price (per mango), calculate the total cost of the mangoes.

function mango(quantity, price) {
    return Math.ceil(quantity - Math.floor(quantity / 3)) * price
}

// console.log(mango(3, 3), 6)
// console.log(mango(9, 5), 30)

//Find out whether the shape is a cube
//To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula: volume = Length * Width * Height But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side! It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube). Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise. Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0). Note: the sides must be integers

var cubeChecker = function(volume, side){
    return volume===side*side*side&&volume>0;
  };
