//I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    return arr1.reduce((a,b)=> a + b, 0) + arr2.reduce((a,b)=> a + b, 0); 
  }

//Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

  function countPositivesSumNegatives(input) {
    let positiveNums = 0;
    let negativeNums = 0;
    if (input === null || input.length === 0) {
      return [];
    } else {
      input.forEach((num) => num > 0 ? positiveNums++ : negativeNums += num);
    }
    return [positiveNums , negativeNums];
}

//It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money? Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean. If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.

function bonusTime(salary, bonus) {
    if (bonus === true){
      return "£" + salary * 10;
    }else{
      return '£' + salary 
    }
  }
